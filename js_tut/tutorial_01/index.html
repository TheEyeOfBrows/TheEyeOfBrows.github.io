            Setting up and Hello World!
        </h1>
        <div class="block">
            <p>
            First we need to set up an environment for writting and running JavaScript.<br/>
            I'm choosing GitHub's <strong>Atom</strong>, which is a pretty nice IDE for JavaScript.<br/>
            Download <strong>Atom</strong> from <a href='https://atom.io/'>atom.io</a>.<br/>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="block">
            <p>
            We're going to add one non-default package to <strong>Atom</strong>
            - browser-plus, which adds an internal web browser to atom, specifically
             with the ability to run live previews of our project.<br/>
            Once installed, open the <strong>File</strong>, <strong>Settings</strong> menu.
            In the newly opened tab, select <strong>Install</strong>, search for
            <strong>browser-plus</strong>, and install it.<br/>
            Close the settings tab when done.  More on browser-plus later.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="block">
            <p>
                Now we're going to set up a project.</br>
                Close all your open tabs in Atom, and open <strong>File</strong>,
                <strong>Open Folder</strong>. Navigate to where you'd like your
                project to live and create a new folder there (right-click menu) with
                the project name (tutorial 1),
                then select that folder and click on the <strong>Select Folder</strong>
                button.</br>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="block">
            <p>
                Right-click the project folder and select <strong>New File</strong>.
                Name the file <strong>index.html</strong>.
                <img class="center" src="images/01_New_File.PNG" />
                <strong>index.html</strong> is a good main page name, because it's used
                as a default name in all web servers.</br>
                Open up that new html file and drop in the following text.
            </p>
            <code><pre>
&#x3C;!DOCTYPE HTML&#x3E;
&#x3C;html&#x3E;
&#x3C;head&#x3E;
    &#x3C;script&#x3E;
    alert('Hello World!');
    &#x3C;/script&#x3E;
&#x3C;/head&#x3E;
&#x3C;body&#x3E;
    A webpage
&#x3C;/body&#x3E;
&#x3C;/html&#x3E;</pre></code>
        </div>
        <div class="block">
            <p>

            Now, let's open up the HTML page in the browser-plus browser.<br/>
            The key combo to open the current file in a new browser tab is <strong>CTRL + ALT + o</strong></br>
            <br />
            So what just happened? In the HTML page we just ran, we had a script block
            run the <code>alert</code> function, which opens a message box with the
            text "Hello World!". This funciton is run by JavaScript for the client using
            the page!<br/>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="block">
            <p>
                Let's break down what's in this HTML file.</br/>
                <br/>
                First look at the first line, <code>&#x3C;!DOCTYPE HTML&#x3E;</code>.
                This HTML element is extra information (meta-data, identified by the exclamation point) for the browser to know
                how to display the page. That flag lets the browser know we're using HTML5,
                which gives us access to some newer HTML features like the <code>&#x3C;script&#x3E;</code>
                shorthand element (older HTML files need to specify what language we're using) along with other
                features we're not yet taking advantage of.<br/>
                <br/>
                Now we have the HTML document definition itself. We start with the root <code>&#x3C;html&#x3E;</code>
                element, which wraps the entire page. The <code>&#x3C;html&#x3E;</code> element contains two elements, the
                <code>&#x3C;head&#x3E;</code>, and the <code>&#x3C;body&#x3E;</code>.<br/>
                <br/>
                The <code>&#x3C;head&#x3E;</code> is where we define things that aren't content, like the page title,
                the links to style documents (css), and external script files (javascript).<br/>
                The <code>&#x3C;body&#x3E;</code> is where we set up the visible content of the page,
                like text and images.<br/>
                In our page, a <code>&#x3C;script&#x3E;</code> element written in the <code>&#x3C;head&#x3E;</code>
                runs that javascript <code>alert</code> function once as the page loads.<br/>
                In the body of the page, our <code>&#x3C;body&#x3E;</code> simply has the pain text <code>A webpage</code>
                to show the user.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="block">
            <p>
                Now let's look at the javascript.<br/>
                <br/>
                Inside the <code>&#x3C;script&#x3E;</code> element, we have the line of code <code>alert('Hello World!');</code> .
                <ul>
                    <li><code>alert</code> is the name of the function we want to run</li>
                    <li>The parentheses ALWAYS follows the name of the function we want to run</li>
                    <li>The parentheses also contains the parameters we want to give to the alert function</li>
                    <li>We want to use the text <strong>Hello World!</strong> as the parameter</li>
                    <li>Text needs to be wrapped in either single quotes ' or double quotes "</li>
                    <li>Single quotes means we DON'T want special characters in our text, and that it should be used as written</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="block">
            <p>
                To elaborate on that last point, sometimes in text you may want to use two lines of text.
                The <strong>new-line character</strong> is <code>\n</code>.<br/>
                <br/>
                Try changing the <code>&#x3C;script&#x3E;</code> element contents to the following.</br>
                <code>alert("Line 1\nLine 2");</code><br/>
                It's important to notice that now we're using the double quotes.<br/>
                Refresh the page and see how now you get text seperated by a new line.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="block">
            <p>
                Let's try a slightly different HTML page.<br/>
                Replace the entire file with the following code.<br/>
            </p>
            <code><pre>
&#x3C;!DOCTYPE HTML&#x3E;
&#x3C;html&#x3E;
&#x3C;head&#x3E;
&#x3C;/head&#x3E;
&#x3C;body&#x3E;
    &#x3C;script&#x3E;
    var newElement = document.createElement('p');
    newElement.innerText = 'Hello World!';
    document.body.appendChild(newElement);
    &#x3C;/script&#x3E;
&#x3C;/body&#x3E;
&#x3C;/html&#x3E;</pre></code>
        </div>
        <div class="block">
            <p>
                Save and refresh the page.<br/>
                You'll see that instead of popping up the alert message box to display the text,
                we're writting the text directly to the page! (alert messages, while useful when developing, are the worst thing for users to ever see)<br/>
                <br/>
                The new script we wrote does the following:<br/>
                <br/>
                First, we create a new HTML element (also known as a DOM element).
                We use the document object (which represents the entire html page) to create a <strong>p</strong> element (for paragraph).
                This new element is stored into the <code>var newElement</code> variable, so we can use it in the following lines of code.<br/>
                <br/>
                Second, we assign some text to the <code>newElement</code> element's
                <code>innerText</code> field, so that it has something to show the user.
                Once again, the text we want to use must be surrounded in quotes.<br/>
                <br/>
                Third and finally, we use <code>appendChild</code> to add the new element to the bottom of the document's body element
                (remember that the html document can only contain a <code>head</code> and a <code>body</code> element).
                The <code>appendChild</code> function puts the new element in the last position of the
                <code>body</code> element. Note that for this function, we're passing in a <strong>variable</strong> instead of text, so we don't need to use quotes here.<br/>
                <br/>
                One question left is why did we move the script out of the <code>&#x3C;head&#x3E;</code>
                element and into the <code>&#x3C;body&#x3E;</code> element?<br/>
                <br/>
                That's because HTML documents are run <strong>IN ORDER</strong> of what's written,
                with the head being executed before the body. That means that if the script is
                executed in the <code>&#x3C;head&#x3E;</code> element, the <code>&#x3C;body&#x3E;</code>
                element doesn't even exist yet because that's further down the page!<br/>
                Know that this is true only for the HTML part of the page, not the JavaScript itself.
                Later on, you'll learn about ways of dealing with this issue.

            <p>
                This is a good time to try experimenting.<br/>
                <br/>
                In the browser tab, try enabling the lightning-bolt button, which
                enables <strong>Live Preview</strong>. Live Preview will refresh the
                browser tab any time the html page is saved, so you can see your changes
                instantly.<br/>
                <br/>
                Try changing the hello world text to instead be a number (without quotes),
                and try doing math with it before assigning it to the newElement. See the links
                at the bottom for more info about variables.

                In the next part, I'll explain how to move the javascript into it's own separate file,
                and how to import an external JavaScript file to use in your page.<br/>
